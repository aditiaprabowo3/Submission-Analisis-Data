# Bike Rentals - Final Project Data Analytics
This is the final project for Dicoding's "Learn Data Analysis with Python" course, where I analyze and create a dashboard based on the bike-sharing dataset. In the provided notebook, I walk through my approach, starting from Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to Data Visualization. Additionally, I developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit.

# Getting Started
## notebook.ipynb
- Download this project.
- Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
- Create a New Notebook.
- Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
- Connect to hosted runtime.
- Lastly, run the code cells.

## dashboard/dashboard.py
- Download this project.
- Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
- Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
- Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py
